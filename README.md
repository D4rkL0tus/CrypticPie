<h2> Introduction </h2>  
<p>
      CrypticPie is a automated crypto trading platform written in python that
      will utilize all the major crypto exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, etc.
      I am still in the works of architeting this software and will slowly be working on this as with
      other projects on other sites as well as here on github.
